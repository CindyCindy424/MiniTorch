MiniTorch is a lightweight Python re-implementation of PyTorch from scratch, designed to be straightforward, easy to understand, and modular. Its key features include a computational graph, auto-differentiation, backpropagation, and CUDA support, while maintaining compatibility with PyTorch. The final library is capable of running Torch code.
