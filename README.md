MiniTorch is a lightweight Python re-implementation of the Torch API, designed to be straightforward, easy to understand, and modular. Its key features include a computational graph, automatic differentiation (autograd), backpropagation, and CUDA support, while maintaining compatibility with PyTorch. The final library is capable of running Torch code.
